# terraform-demo
So you want to learn how to distribute infrastructure as code? Nice! Let's see if I can help by giving you some examples you can follow. The examples I'm going to run through will deploy infrastructure to AWS. If there's enough interest I'd be happy to provide examples for GCP, Azure, or anything else you might like. For now though let's start with AWS. Head over to the [AWS Signup Page](https://aws.amazon.com/) to create an account and I'll see you in a few minutes. Head's up, you will need to use a credit card for this. I promise, I'll do my best to make everything we create here inexpensive, but it's not going to be free. If it's going to be more than a few bucks though, I'll definitely give you a head's up. 

# The manual steps
You need a key to start the ball rolling, there's no real way around that, but you'll import it into your bootstrap workspace almost immediately. Browse to the [IAM User Creation Page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users/create) and add a user called "bootstrap" (leave the "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" checkbox unchecked). Select "Attach policies directly" and choose "AdministratorAccess" from the list. Now select the bootstrap user and go to the "Security Credentials" tab. Scroll down to Access Keys and click the "Create access key" button. Set the tag as "TerraformBootstrap" and click "Create access key."
